 1-Basics of photoshop using inkscape

<p>There are two types of image- vector and rostar.
A look at the picture next to us will give you a preliminary
idea on what the difference between them is.</p>

 <img src="img/day2/vs.png" alt="vector vs rostar img">

<p>Now zoom in to each of the pictures are much as you can,
   the rostar picture will get pixelated, whereas the vector picture always
 maintains a smooth appearnace, this is because vector images
 an artwork made up of points, lines, and curves that are based upon mathematical equations,
 rather than solid colored square pixels.</p>

<p>why does this matter? Well,
  vinyl cutters only cut vector images.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Inkscape is an open source (meaning free) graphics software.
  We are going to start by downloading the app.</p>
  <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Click here to go to the Inkscape website</a>
  <img src="img/day2/img1.PNG" alt=""> <img src="img/day2/img2.PNG" alt="">
<p>After downloading, open the app and have a around, and lets
  start by adding random shapes
<br>

<br>

Now we will go over  a very important concept- stroke and fill.
 Fill of the shape is the filling and stroke is the line.
 To use a vinyl cutter, you need to have no fill, only the outline or stroke.
 You can change stroke and fill setting by going to "object".

<br>

Other useful tools are union, inset, offset and group.
 You can see these in the "path" and "object" tabs.
There are many tutorials on youtube on how to use all these tools.

</p>

<p>My first project was to make a sticker to put on a shirt. We used a heat
transfer vinyl sheet. My design promt was the lab I'm working in, so I decided
to mkae a logo! When i think of "logo" I think circles, so I began by drawing
a circle, then duplicatimg it and using the inset tool to make two concentric circles
like shown below, then I added some text. </p>

<p>Then I looked up Technology clip art and downloaded this:
  <br>

  <img src="sticker/tech1.PNG" width="65%">
<br>
<br>
This however, is a rostar image. We can convert to ector using a very handy tool
 in "path". You select the image, go to <strong>path ----> trace bitmap</strong>
 and there ypu have it. Our final logo.

<br>
<br>
Then, I made a sleeve logo using our handy trick,
 I looked up house of wisdom logo (the library I'm working in),
 took this picture, then path---> trace bitmap.

  2-How to use a vinyl cutter




<p>
Something we forgot to do in the begginning was to test out machine.
Always do a test first.
The pictire on the left is what happened because
 we forgot to test the pen force and
the one on left is what was supposed to happen.
Always test your pen force!

  <p> Points to talk abtme; Black n white,
     stroke and fill,some useful tools,
     how to pirate pics, sensors and setting an origin point
   how to peel off sticker</p>
     Here is a helpful video:

3-Mistakes I made so you dont have to

  <p>

<strong>MISTAKE 1:</strong>
Dont forget to check your stroke annf fill before you print.

<br>

<strong>MISTAKE 2:</strong> Check your opacity. Dont ussume it's 100%
we assumed it was 100% (it was 97%) and spent 20 mins trying to figure out
why it wasnt printing.

<br>

<strong>MISTAKE 3:</strong> Check your measurements and the
above conditions again if you make a last minute edit.
It may scew your measuremts (most probably will).
