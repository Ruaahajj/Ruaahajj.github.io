<h1>Day 1</h1>

<p>
  First, I made a github accunt,then downloaded github.

  Then, I made a repository with the name "Ruaahajj".
  Making a repositry can be done by going to** file**-->**new repository**.
  Or simply by pressing **CTR + N**

<br>
Now, this begs the question: *what IS a repository?*
<br>In simple terms, it's storage for your code. Kind of like a cloud for your code.

<p>
Next, we have to create an html file to add to our repository.
To do this, open the notes app, go to **file**--> **save as**-->
and save it with the **html extention** (very important!! highlighted below).
